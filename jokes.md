I took my wife to my job's holiday party and they said to her, "We love Dan, 
he's so funny." Then my wife and son cut half my jokes out of his bar mitzvah
speech.  Fine, so I was a little upset, but then my friend pointed out to me
that 50% joke retention from your teenage son isn't that bad.

My wife talks about how she learned from me various things, like, "I learned
from you how to deal with the kids in such-and-such way without getting upset."
But when she says this, I feel like I also need to say what I learned from her.

I don't know what it's like in other countries but working in America people
love using analogies to explain situations or problems.  Like car analogies,
people love those.   

I have a lot of online friends, people that I've been posting on message boards
with for like 20, 25 years.  People I knew as a teenager, and now we're both
in our 40s.  And these are pretty normal guy-level friendships, and by guy level
I mean like if they die tomorrow I'd be kinda bummed, but they're not like CLOSE
friends.  Anyway, it occurs to me every once in a while that because I've never
met these people it's very possible that they're all extremely mentally ill.
I'm 100% The Normal One.
