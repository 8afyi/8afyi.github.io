I took my wife to my job's holiday party and they said to her, "We love Dan, 
he's so funny." Then my wife and son cut half my jokes out of his bar mitzvah
speech.  Fine, so I was a little upset, but then my friend pointed out to me
that 50% joke retention from your teenage son isn't that bad.

My wife talks about how she learned from me various things, like, "I learned
from you how to deal with the kids in such-and-such way without getting upset."
But when she says this, I feel like I also need to say what I learned from her.

I don't know what it's like in other countries but working in America people
love using analogies to explain situations or problems.  Like car analogies,
people love those.
